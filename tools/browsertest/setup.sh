# One-time setup for the browser test environment (see README.md here).
# Installs, entirely without root, into tools/browsertest/env/ (gitignored):
#   - playwright-core + pngjs (npm)
#   - playwright's Firefox build (the only browser whose WebGL works in
#     sandboxed/headless agent environments — via Xvfb; Chrome's V8 cannot
#     start under a capped virtual address space at all)
#   - Xvfb, extracted from the Ubuntu package (no install, no root) — SKIPPED
#     when the machine already has an Xvfb on PATH, which is how this works on
#     a non-Debian distro, where `apt-get download` does not exist.
# Total download is ~180 MB. Idempotent: safe to re-run.
#
# Playwright's Firefox is dynamically linked against the ordinary GTK3 desktop
# stack, which a minimal container may not have. This script does NOT install
# those (they need root and they are distro-specific) — it checks for them at
# the end and prints the one command that fixes it. On Fedora that is:
#   sudo dnf install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb gtk3 alsa-lib dbus-libs \
#        mesa-libGL mesa-libEGL mesa-dri-drivers dejavu-sans-fonts
