/**
 * A lazily-read set of plane-wave wavefunctions — the proxy object a WAVECAR
 * becomes.
 *
 * The file is never held in memory. `io/ReadWavecarModule.js` decodes the two
 * header records and hands the geometry plus a record-position function here;
 * everything after that is read on demand, one band at a time, through
 * `io/FileSource.js`.
 *
 * Turning a band into something the isosurface code can draw is three steps:
 *
 *   coefficients (read from the file)
 *     -> scattered into an FFT box at their G-vectors
 *     -> inverse 3D FFT, reduced to a real scalar
 *
 * All three run in `docs/compiled/wave_backend.c`, off the main thread when a
 * worker is available. The result is an ordinary `model/Field.js`, so nothing
 * downstream — marching cubes, cut planes, either tracer — knows a wavefunction
 * is involved.
 *
 * A non-collinear file adds one branch to that. Its band is a two-component
 * spinor rather than a single wavefunction, so both halves are transformed and
 * `getField` takes a `SpinorComponent` saying which piece is wanted: one of the
 * amplitudes, or one element of the band's density matrix. Everything else —
 * the caching, the record layout, the G-vectors — is identical.
 *
 * Both the raw coefficients and the expanded fields are cached under one shared
 * byte budget (`model/LruByteCache.js`), because they differ in size by orders
 * of magnitude and counting entries would manage the wrong thing.
 *
 * Structured after httk's `PlaneWaveFunctions`
 * (httk/atomistic/wavefunction.py), with two deliberate differences: httk's
 * cache is unbounded, and httk transforms on a box of exactly 2*kgrid whereas
 * this pads up to a 5-smooth size (see the C).
