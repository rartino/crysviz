// --- Measurement value labels, as real depth-tested 3D objects ------------
//
// These used to be CSS2DObjects: HTML divs layered over the WebGL canvas by
// CSS2DRenderer. That is the root cause of every "the label is drawn on top
// of an atom that's in front of it" problem — a DOM overlay is composited
// after WebGL is done and never touches the depth buffer, so it ALWAYS
// paints over the scene no matter what is between it and the camera. The
// only way to hide one was to approximate the depth test in JS (raycasts,
// projected-radius overlap tests, tuned thresholds), and an approximation of
// a per-pixel test always leaves gaps: an atom covering part of the label
// but not the sampled point, an atom slightly off the ray, a threshold right
// at the boundary.
//
// Rendering the value as a THREE.Sprite instead makes the GPU do it exactly:
// the sprite is real geometry in the scene, so the depth buffer clips it
// per-pixel against atoms, bonds and polyhedra — including partial overlap
// (half the label behind a sphere, half still visible), which no JS
// approximation can reproduce. Same technique ChargeBadgeModule.js uses for
// charge badges (depthTest:true, depthWrite:false, transparent), which is
// the rendering this feature was originally asked to match.
// Base on-screen height of a value pill, in world units, before the user's
// Settings multiplier (general.measureLabelScale). Halved from the original
// 0.85 — the sprites read considerably larger than the old CSS2D pills did.
// 0.294 = the old 0.42 at a 0.7 slider setting, which is what the default
// should have been — the Settings slider now reads 1.00 at that size.
